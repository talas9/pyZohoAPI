## About pyZohoAPI

**pyZohoAPI** provides Pythonic access to Zoho APIs in the Finance Plus suite:
_Books, Checkout, Expense, Inventory, Invoice, and Subscriptions_.

```{note}
As of this release, we only have support for _Inventory_ and _Books_, and not every
object therein. Full support will be built out incrementally over future releases.
```

This package provides Python objects which correlate to the objects exposed by
the Zoho API. The Python objects provide a simple way to access, update, create,
delete and modify Zoho objects. We don't strive to encapsulate operations Zoho
performs in its clients; that's up to your code.
